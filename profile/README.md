Digital Waters is a non-profit organization with the goal of ensuring clean and healthy water for all creatures in all our waterways through advanced monitoring and community engagement.

As a non-profit, all our device, cloud, communications, and presentation software is open source and dependant on the contributions of our open source community members

Our software revolves around fourlarger efforts:

* Device software to capture and send water data to our cloud.
* Cloud software to accept and process data requests.
* Data analysis and AI to make sense of all the data we collect
* Data presentation. Websites and APIs that show the distilled water quality data.
